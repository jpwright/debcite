This is the source code fro debcite, a citation retrieval engine to make retrieving evidence from the public wiki for intercollegiate policy debates easier and more efficient. It parses shorthand citations and uses a variety of techniques, including the Google and Yahoo search APIs, to try to retrieve the full text of the evidence being cited.

It's written in PHP and JavaScript with MySQL, and the primary implementation is at http://www.jpwright.net/debcite
